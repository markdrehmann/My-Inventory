# My Inventory

Welcome to the My Inventory! This app was built as a tech challenge for a job application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on the frontend, and with a Rails API backend.

### Installation

To shut down both servers, hit `ctrl+c` in the `/my-inventory` directory, as well as the `/my-inventory/backend` directory.
